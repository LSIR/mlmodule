- **Image similarity search**: Rank images by their similarity to query image.
- **Image classification**: Add labels to images.
- **Face detection**: Detect and retrieve images with similar faces.
- **Object detection**: Detect and retrieve images with similar objects.
- **Video keyframes extraction**: Retrieve the important frames of a video.
  Key-frames are used to apply all the other queries on videos.
