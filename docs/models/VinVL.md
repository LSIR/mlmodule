# VinVL

Pre-trained large-scale object-attribute detection (OD) model is based on the ResNeXt-152 C4 architecture.
The OD model has been firstly trained on much larger amounts of data, combining multiple public object detection datasets, including [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home), [OpenImages (OI)](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html), [Objects365](https://www.objects365.org/overview.html), and [Visual Genome (VG)](https://visualgenome.org/). Then it is fine-tuned on VG dataset alone, since VG is the only dataset with label attributes (see [issue #120](https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar/issues/120#issuecomment-898781183)). It predicts objects from 1594 classes with attributes from 524 classes.
See the [code](https://github.com/pzzhang/VinVL) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00529.pdf) for details.


## Requirements

The model needs the configuration system [YACS](https://github.com/rbgirshick/yacs) to be installed.

```bash
pip install yacs==0.1.8
```

## Models

The VinVL model is an implementation of a [`TorchMlModule`][mlmodule.v2.torch.modules.TorchMlModule].
